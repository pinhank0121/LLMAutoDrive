# Exploring LLM Capabilities in Autonomous Driving Simulation (CSIE 5452 Final Project)

# Abstract

This research project explores the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) driving agents in autonomous driving simulations. The project is mainly based on the Dilu framework. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

1. We first conducted several case studies to investigate the factors contributing to poor zero-shot performance and identified specific reasoning limitations of the LLM driving agent. 

2. Based on these observations, we attempted to address these issues through prompt engineering and few-shot in-context learning. 

3. We developed a rule base algorithm agent and prompts inspired by rule-based principles.

4. We implemented Dilu in the 'roundabout' environment, which is not covered by the original paper. (See branch roundabout).
