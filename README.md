# Abstract

This research project explores the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) driving agents in autonomous driving simulations. The project is mainly based on the Dilu framework. Our contributions are summarized as follows:
(1) We first conducted several case studies to investigate the factors contributing to poor zero-shot performance and identified specific reasoning limitations of the LLM driving agent. 
(2) Based on these observations, we attempted to address these issues through prompt engineering and few-shot in-context learning. 
(3) We explored Dilu in other simulation environments not covered by the paper.
